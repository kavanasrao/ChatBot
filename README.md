# DhiTvam: 
The Companion for Your Inner Journey.

"Dhi" symbolizes profound understanding, and "Tvam" reflects the essence of you. In a world flooded with chatbots designed for information retrieval, DhiTvam stands apart. Its mission isnâ€™t just to answer questions but to listen, to be there when you need someone the most.

# Because in your moments of silence, DhiTvam listens.
