With meticulous planning and boundless zeal, the king orchestrated the construction of this new haven, complete with elegant streets, lush gardens, and vibrant marketplaces. His vision was to create a flourishing sanctuary for his people and himself after his term ended.As the new town rose from the fertile land, it became a beacon of prosperity and harmony.When the time came for the king’s departure from Kashi, he crossed the river to his new abode, which had become a testament to his enduring legacy. King Vikramaditya's foresight ensured that both Kashi and his new town thrived, leaving behind a legacy of wisdom and elegance that inspired generations to come."

His path was fraught with failures and setbacks, but each obstacle only fueled his resolve. Through perseverance and dedication, he played a pivotal role in India's space and missile programs, rising from a small-town boy to become one of the nation's most beloved scientists and the 11th President of India.Dr. Kalam's life is a testament to overcoming adversity with unwavering determination and humility."
